# PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to perform an exploratory analysis on data in large csv files. The aim is to create several types of visualizarions to tell a compelling story showcasing the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and rides. The analysis is meant to help Pyber improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for under-served neighbourhoods.
The final assigment is to create (using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib) a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

## Summary
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types
